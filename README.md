## Simple Project in Facebook Password Strength Prediction with NLP 🤨 🧐 Using Random Forest Classifier: 93%

### Business Understanding 😇 
This time, I want to try NLP or Natural Language Processing by doing a simple project, namely classification or prediction of the strength of passwords using a dataset of labeled Facebook passwords. As we know that passwords are something that is private 😱😱. We as data scientists want to help users secure their passwords so that their passwords are not too easily guessed by people or programs. Therefore, one of the solutions is to notify users that the strength of their password is weak or strong. If it is weak, it means that the password needs to be improved. Lesgoo🫡🫡

### Data Understanding 😁
This dataset contains 100 thousand data about passwords from various accounts that may be inactive or no longer used. The dataset contains the following:
- index: primary key or unique id
- password: contains the password text
- strength: a label that indicates how strong the password is (0 = weak, 1 = medium, 2 = strong)


### Data Preparation: 
- Cleaning data
- Feature Engineering 😢
- feature importance
- tf-idf


### Modeling 😨 😰
- Logistic Regression
- Logistic Regression CV
- Random Forest Classifier


### Evaluation 🧐 🤓 😎
- accuracy
- recall
- f1-score
- precision
